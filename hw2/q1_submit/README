IMPLEMENTATION: 
Model - All nodes listen on a fixed port 30014, except for rank 0- which listens on NPROC ports only in barrier phase. Ranks and number of process are decided based on reading the node file. 
In barrier- all nodes send a message to node 0 on port 30014+rank, and set their flags, rank 0 aknowledges. Untill this stage, all nodes continuously poll. 
After acknowledgement nodes exit barrier and init and move further with sends and recieve. Implementation of large files is taken care by waiting appropriately for recieving all the bytes and setting correct flags for barrier and recieve phase. Concurrency issues are taken care by using mutexes. 


TO RUN: 
Use make file to run. 
make -f p1.Makefile --- compile
make run -f p1.Makefile -- run
